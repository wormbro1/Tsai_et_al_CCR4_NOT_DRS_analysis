# Tsai_et_al_CCR4_NOT_DRS_analysis
This repository includes the scripts used for Direct RNA sequencing analysis (both polyA tail length measurements and differential expression) of HeLa cells treated with arsenite/lipoamide. The reference genome used was hg38 (appended with the yeast ENO2 transcript sequence for the spike-in analysis). Thee NCBI Refseq hg38 annotation file was used for this anlaysis. Packages used include:
* Dorado (v0.9.0)
* samtools (v1.21)
* featureCounts (v2.1.1)
